      <h1>The story: You are a 5th grader (or whatever grade you're in, idk), and you have somehow opened up an wormhole in 2048, where you are 38 years old. While there, you are trying to become the President of the United States of America. You are in your office, making plans for taking over the government. Unfortunetly, a secret agent thinks something is off, and he wants you to answer his questions, to prove you're not an imposter or something!!</h1>
